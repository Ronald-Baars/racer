# Racer

Hi, Thanks for checking out this experimental Racing game. The past few weeks 
I've been working on making it as best as I could in the time I had, I'll
continue working on it when I've got more free time.

## How it works
Wait for it...

## To do
* Add objects to collide in
* Design the menu
* Make the finish count laps
* Add checkpoints to prevent cheating
* Add Collision detection
  * Drive slow on grass
  * Crash into solid objects (there arn't any now)

## Known bugs
I've been working hard to get it where it is now, unfortunately there still are some bugs.

* **You have to resize the browser when you choose a track** (it doesn't automatically redraw)
